# search_command

This project adds a terminal command aptly named "search", which allows you to enter a question, after which it launches the top stackoverflow search result, or the top result in a new tab.

The idea is to save having to navigate to chrome and look through the results, lazy, I know.

Packages to install:
  $ pip install google && beautifulsoup4
